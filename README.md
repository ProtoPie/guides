## :wastebasket: Delete a guide

**We have two ways how to delete a guide:**
1. Select a line and press the button 'Delete';
2. Click on a line and drag to the relative ruler.
# Functions

- `deleteSelectedGuide` - this function is used when a user selected a line and press the 'Delete' button;

```tsx
    public deleteSelectedGuide() {
        // get all active guides
        const guides = this.getGuides();
        // find the index of the guide which the user selected
        const index = guides.findIndex(guide => {
            if(this.state.selectedGuides.includes(guide)){
                return guide;
            }
        });
        // call the event what return the index and value of a deleted guide
        /**
         * When the drag is deleted, the deleteGuide event is called.
         * @memberof Guides
         * @event deleteGuide
         * @param {OnDeleteGuide} - Parameters for the deleteGuide event
         */
        this.props.onDeleteGuide!({
            deletedPosGuide: guides[index],
            deletedIndexGuide: index,
        });
        
        guides.splice(index, 1);
        // push new arrays of guides to the state and clear the array which contains a selected line
        this.setState({
            guides,
            selectedGuides: []
        });
    }
```

# Selected line
When the user selected the line we called function  `selectGuide` and this line changes its color to **![#8169FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8169FF/8169FF.png) #8169FF**. And if the user clicks anywhere except the line we call a function `resetSelected` for cleaning the array with selected lines.
